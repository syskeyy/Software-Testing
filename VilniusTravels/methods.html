      <p><strong>White Box Testing: </strong> <br> This testing technique is used to examine the program structure and business logic, it validates the code or program of an application. <br> It is also called as Clear Box Testing, Glass Box Testing or Open Box Testing.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Black Box Testing: </strong> <br> This testing method is used to test the functionality of an application based on the requirement specification. <br> Unlike White Box Testing it does not focus on internal structure/code of the application.
      </p>    
      <p><strong>Grey Box Testing: </strong> <br> This method of testing is performed with less information about the internal structure of an application. <br> Generally, this is performed like Black Box Testing only but for some critical areas of application, White Box Testing is used.
